# mcda (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis)

This repo contains a set of python scripts to implement some Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) algorithms learned during Graduate Coursework. The scripts were one off for coursework, but require maintaining for more general use.

Implemented Algorithms
- Goal Programming
- Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)
- Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluation (PROMETHEE)
